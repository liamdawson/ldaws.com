I'm Liam Dawson, a Melbourne, Australia based "full stack" developer, with a
fondness for statically typed languages, a preference for simple code, and a
long tradition of learning the hard way.

I have a
[modest collection of board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/jesterfraud?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1),
and
[a very friendly cat](https://www.instagram.com/phoebe.consuela/).
I've written command line tools to
[change the colour of a USB LED flag](https://github.com/liamdawson/lfcl),
given
[internal talks about unit testing](/posts/foundational-unit-testing),
and once wrote a
[watchface for Android Wear devices](https://github.com/liamdawson/lawful-neutral).

My opinions are personal, and don't reflect the opinions or stances of my
employers past or present.
